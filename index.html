                            Happy Gilmore is a 1996 American sports comedy film directed by Dennis Dugan with music by Mark Mothersbaugh and produced by Robert Simonds.

The film was released in cinemas on February 16, 1996 by Universal Pictures. Happy Gilmore was a commercial success, earning $41.2 million on a $12 million budget.

                            Happy Gilmore is an aspiring ice hockey player who possesses a powerful and dangerous slapshot that his father taught him as a child before he was apparently struck and killed by a wayward hockey puck. After another failed tryout, Gilmore's girlfriend Terry, a school teacher, leaves him because of his hockey obsession and lack of success.

                                Happy's grandmother owes $270,000 in back taxes, and the IRS repossesses her home and threatens to auction it off in 90 days unless she can repay the full amount. While supervising the repossession of his grandma's furniture, a pair of removals men challenge Happy to a long-drive contest using Happy's grandfather's antique clubs. With an unorthodox, hockey slapshot-style swing, Happy hits a ball that strikes a house some 400 yards away, and wins $40 after the guys bet he cannot do it again. As a result, he starts hustling golfers with his swing at the driving range. There, he is spotted by Chubbs Peterson, a one-handed former golf star and current club pro, who convinces Happy to enter a local tournament to earn a spot on the Pro Golf Tour, which Happy only accepts after Chubbs informs him of the significant prize money involved. Happy wins the tournament and a spot on the Tour.

						In April 2012, Boo was the subject of a death hoax after #RIPBOO appeared on Facebook. Tweets followed as Gizmodo writer Sam Biddle tweeted Boo had died. It was later confirmed by The Chronicle Book staff that Boo was alive and well. In July 2012, Boo was named the Official Pet Liaison of Virgin America.
